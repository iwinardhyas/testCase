TEST INSTRUCTIONS

Please create a small service that accepts as input a body of text, such as that from a book, and returns the top ten most-used words along with how many times they occur in the text.
This task should be completed using GoLang and uploaded to GitHub.
Please include a loom video recording:
    • Video #1: quick intro for yourself, your education, work experience, and zoom in to your Golang experience
    • Video #2: walkthrough of your understanding of the test requirements, and the way you implemented your solution
